There seems to be a harmful degree of scientific fundamentalism. I've always upheld the principles of pure materialism, or rather physicalism. The idea that everything, including our consciousness, is an emergent property from the interactions of neurons and nothing more. This is a comforting philosophy because it implies that we can one day come to understand how the brain works entirely. However, that ignores the fact that it would be logically impossible to understand yourself that way. For the same reason that you can't put a bigger box inside a smaller box without changing its shape, you can't fully understand your brain with your brain. In addition, every single moment, your brain is essentially rewriting itself, which is how memory works. I never acknowledged this.

So when I realised that I was in fact suffering from depression, I figured this was just some kind of mechanical imbalance. I'd read up on serotonin and dopamine and a whole bunch of other hormones that affect your mind, and I decided that those must be out of whack, that that's why I felt the way I did. This steered me out on the path of anti-depressants. As I've mentioned before, I truly believed that would fix things just like that.

The thing is, and I'm not trying to trivialize or generalize or anything, but my depression was mainly fueled by the way I decided to think and how I dealt with things happening. I'd convinced myself that I was not in control, but that something outside my mind was. It sounds kind of ridiculous when I think about it now, but it definitely made, and still makes some sort of sense. It's just not the way things work, not for me. I found out that I can literally just will myself to be happy and thatâ€¦ that works.

For some reason, a distrust and dislike of pretty much anything has become part of my personality. I'm pretty sure most anyone will corroborate that I'm pretty much defined by cynicism. This is difficult, because it's what I'm used to and people seem to be amused by it. Now, I'm all for entertaining others, but I musn't internalize it the way I did.

The way I see it, yes, there is a whole goddamn awful lot wrong with the world. There always has been, there always will be. It's all good to think about how to improve it, I try to do that and encourage others to do the same. That doesn't mean that it makes any sense to worry about how bad everything is unless you're working on that. Most of the time, it's better to just let go of all the bad, focus on the good and let that affect you. This is the hardest thing to do, but also the only way to make any sense of the world without resorting to just cowering in a corner explaining all the reasons why getting out of that corner is a bad idea.
