I think this has to be at least the tenth blog I've set up in my life. I hope this one has a more permanent nature though, seeing as it's my entire website. This is my attempt at reviving my website and basically having an outlet for news on anything I'm doing. AdSweep for example. I'm going to devote another post to that subject later.

Since this does feel like a 'post because I need content'-post, I'm going to stop here. Have a look around my (still empty) website if you feel so inclined, and see you soon.
