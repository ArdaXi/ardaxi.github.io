I'm hereby releasing a beta version of the new online AdSweep. Seeing as it's beta I haven't had that much time to debug, so please send me bug reports through the usual channels. As for the YouTube 'bug', I'm going to include the code by default, please disable AdSweep on YouTube if you mind having to reload sometimes. It now has a button in the top-right, which allows you to disable it and download all the rules to cache.

<!-- more -->I really recommend you download all the rules first by clicking the button, because this speeds it up rapidly. This new version can be downloaded[ here](http://arienh4.net/AdSweep-beta.crx) and of course I still expect a lot of bug reports. This install will not auto-update, so keep watching my blog for new versions, which will probably happen a lot. A site can be removed from the disabled list on the options page.
