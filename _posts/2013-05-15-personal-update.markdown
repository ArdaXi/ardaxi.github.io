title: Personal Update
---

Well, it has been awhile... again. Every time, I intend to update my blog more often, and every time, 6 months pass before I get around to it. Typical. Oh well, anyway. It seems my life is slowly becoming more interesting, and what is a self-absorbed hacker to do if not show it off. Here goes.

First of all, a little less than a year ago, I joined a hackerspace in Amsterdam called [Technologia Incognita](http://techinc.nl/). It's generally an awesome place with awesome people. I suppose that was where I decided to be more active and not just do my hacking at home in front of a computer screen.

Meanwhile, I've been dealing with quite a bit of personal stuff. I generally had a tough ride the past few years, which means that a bunch of stuff is going to be more difficult than it had to be. Fortunately, I do have a good feeling about where I'm going from here, so I suppose that counts for something.

Sadly, I haven't really been doing as much programming as I used to. Mostly, I'm just looking at the work of awesome people and throw in a word or two every now and then. However, I'm also looking to change that. To that end, I finally decided to do what I've been meaning to for awhile, and founded my own company. I am now officially a self-employed freelance software engineer. Woo. I have also been nominated for the Procrastinator of the Year award for this fact, because I founded a company instead of studying for my exams. Well, you've got to have your priorities straight, no?

So I suppose that concludes my little update. Decided to completely redo my blog (which shouldn't be noticeable if I did it right) but at least I'm not using WordPress any more. I'll see if I can keep this little space updated a little more often, but who knows.
