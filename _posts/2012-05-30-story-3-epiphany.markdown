It took quite a while, but inevitably, enlightenment struck. It was simply a matter of logic. Slowly, he realized people weren't as different as they seemed. Everyone pretty much has the same kind of feelings, but like him, they hid them from everyone else. This didn't change a thing about the fact that they too wanted companionship, friendship, all those things. But when he thought about how often he reached out to someone who seemed unreachable... never, really.

Most people have plenty of other people to be around. This didn't in any way diminish his chances, as if there wouldn't be any room for him. It just meant that he was the one who had to go out of his way to make himself desirable. Besides, what's the point of avoiding taking risks just to make sure you reach death safely? He sighed as he set about to change his entire view on life.

After a while, he had an entire new perspective fleshed out, for interacting with people. For one, why hold a grudge? Sure, if someone does you wrong, then you should do whatever you can to prevent them from doing you wrong ever again. This changes your relationship with that person. However, quite often you still have to see this person every day, because it's a classmate or a colleague or something like that. You shouldn't pretend you don't know them, just stay on good terms with them. You never know when it might come in useful. Just make sure to set boundaries.

Blame is meaningless. It might be all your fault, it might all be theirs. Why does it matter? What matters is the outcome. Worry about how you can improve the outcome, forget about how you can't. This empowers you to do what you can, because you don't expend energy trying to do something you can't. As for blame, forgive, but never forget. Everything that happens to you has some kind of lesson embedded that you take with you for the rest of your life. Never let anything convince you to forget those lessons.
