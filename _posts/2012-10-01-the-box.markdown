Hyde walked up to the giant office building. The brightly lit sign above his head read 'ACME Industries'. He sighed, trying to work up the courage to walk inside and ring the bell. As he waited, he found himself wondering how it had got to this.

If only he hadn't found that damned box. That's when this whole witch-hunt had begun. Of course he was going to open it. What else was he going to do? It had his fucking name on it. And he just— well, too late for that now. That... thing was inside it. That – doll is too good a name – but it will have to do. It kept following him around, with those eyes.

<!-- more -->He just couldn't take any more. He grabbed the doll and locked it back in its box. As the doll tried to escape, he threw the box into the burning fireplace. Satisfied, he tried to walk out and get some fresh air, but all he could see out of the window were flames, everywhere. In a reflex, he extinguished the box, and watched the flames outside his window disappear. All he could hear was that cackling doll's laugh.

He tried to call the police. They wouldn't take him seriously, and just hung up on him mid-sentence. Immediately, someone called him back. "I'm Agent Nera with the Foundation. We heard your report. Please join us immediately. Bring the box." He wrote down the address, yanked the box out and left.
