I’m going to start this off with a disclaimer. I am a young, naive, depressed guy with autism. I spend a lot of time pretending, or trying to make people think that that’s not what I am. I’m not intending to do that now. What I am going to write probably seems lame, naive, cheesy, obvious, angsty. I don’t care. I am all of those things. This is also more of a diary entry than anything else. I’m writing this to get a bunch of stuff out of my head. Who knows, maybe you’ll like it.

This actually came to me while listening to James Blunt’s new album. The specific music isn’t really that important, it’s about the lyrics. I happen to love his music because I love the lyrics. Most of them are love songs or close to it, which is exactly why they appeal to me.

Of course, while quoting something like that, I feel silly. Like angst is some thing that people are not supposed to express. That quoting song lyrics is bad form, that it makes me look stupid. That it’s just looking for attention. I can’t even accurately put it into words. All I know is that this form of ‘expression’ is not done.

And yet James Blunt, and other artists like him are incredibly popular. Somehow, singer-songwriters seem to have a monopoly on expressing the feelings and experiences that we all have. Judging by their success, these are things that resonate with many people. I can’t do poetry, I can’t sing. I could probably learn if I really wanted to, but my medium of choice is prose. It’s what I most enjoy doing. I’d like to think I’m relatively good at it.

So where does that leave me? I’ve caught myself more than a few times publishing song lyrics like these to Twitter. I still have about 300 followers and I hardly hear any responses to it whatsoever, so I suppose people don’t really mind, although I’ve had some comments from people who see it posted to Facebook. People do accuse me of looking for attention.

I don’t disagree with that analysis, as I’ve mentioned before. However, I wonder. What is it about looking for attention that we find so inherently wrong, unattractive? I’m a 19-year-old. A lot of life is new to me. As a child I’ve never had any trouble with the intellectual, factual side of life. I’ve embraced that kind of thing. Learning comes easy for me. Sure, I’ve never been social, but that never really bothered me back then.

Puberty, of course, throws all of that into disarray. As I’m writing this right now there’s this voice in the back of my head telling me “all of the people who are going to read this have gone through that. They know all this already.” That sentiment has kept me from writing a lot of stuff like this. Fortunately, I’m the kind of person who doesn’t really care what other people think. It took me a while to get there, but I like where I am now, in that sense.

Anyway, I was ranting about puberty. At that point, of course, romantic interests start to pop up. It’s then that I finally started feeling loneliness. It’s really weird, it’s something I didn’t have to deal with up until that point. I adopted the whole Forever Alone moniker long before that ever became a thing. *Yes, I know that’s a slightly contradictory sentiment.*

I’ve since had a slightly complicated relationship for a while, which I thought had fixed things. In a way, it did. While I was with her, I never really felt too lonely. At least in the beginning. I remember well this one time when we went to see a musical. It was some story about faeries which is not really relevant here, but this started out with the protagonist talking *(well, singing)* about how she felt neglected by her parents and excluded from everyone at school.

*A quick sidenote, I do not feel neglected by my parents in any way. My parents are absolutely the best people I could have ever wished for. They have always been incredibly supportive even though they could never really understand me. The strength that especially my mother has shown the past few years is incredible and I need to acknowledge that.*

Regardless, the story resonated with me in an amazingly strong way. Despite the fact that I had a loving girlfriend next to me at the time, I felt incredibly alone in this world. I still do. I wish I could explain it somehow, but I cannot. I have the best friend I could wish for. I did then, too. I do not know what I am missing. But I am missing something.

Yeah, I’m quoting him again. The truth is, I do seek attention. I do want people to notice I’m not okay. But then, when they do, I cannot deal with it. People do reach out to me sometimes. “If you ever feel down, let me know, we can go do something.” It’s well-meant, surely. I genuinely appreciate those people. But I cannot step over the threshold of taking them up on that offer.

So now I turn to the only medium I have at my disposal. I write. I try to get it all off. Perhaps someone will take something away from it. Perhaps someone can help me. At least it’s all out of my head now.
