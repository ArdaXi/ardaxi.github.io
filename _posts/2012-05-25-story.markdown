He sat down at his desk. He felt the familiar touch of his keyboard under his fingers. It was always a relief to be back at his computer. It was the only thing he felt he could actually depend on. Circuits only do what you tell them to do after all, no more, no less. People were different. People can't be trusted the way machines can. He thought about Artificial Intelligence. 'Making machines more like people,' he thought to himself and scoffed. How would that ever be useful? His computer beeped, to show it was ready. He tried to resist the urge to look up those people that had rejected him before. It's always so difficult to see people doing better than you, especially if they're people you can't stand. Of course, none of them _actually _had a better life than him, but he didn't know that or didn't want to know. He finally found the courage to close the browser window again.

<!-- more -->He opened a bunch of other sites and checked his messages, of which there were none, as usual. It's funny, the way people tell you they're there for you, the way they might tell the terminal sick. Whenever you come to them, sure, they'll talk to you, they'll listen to your feelings. However, the moment you stop coming to them, it's like you cease to exist. Someday he'd just like to see someone come talking to him unprovoked. He wondered if anyone else ever felt this way. Probably not. People don't tend to keep their feelings to themselves. They're constantly surrounded by people. They seem happy. That means they are happy.

He looked at the chatrooms he was in. At least he still had them, and IM contacts. Nice and anonymous, no obligations, just the way he liked it. He grabbed a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and lit one up. Somehow, he liked the idea of being dependent on something, as long as it wasn't someone he depended on. He clicked past site after site in his attempts to replace a social life. His friends were probably hanging out somewhere, but how would he know? He started an IM conversation one of his online friends. There were quite a few of these contacts, people that he had never even seen in real life before. Somehow, they knew him best. Probably because he had no reason whatsoever to lie about himself to someone he didn't even know personally. The conversation quickly turned into an intervention.

"Just ask a couple friends and go do something," they said. "Nothing's going to happen unless you make it happen."

"Well, that's the point, isn't it?" he replied. He thought to himself how unfortunate it was that his annoyance could not reach the other end of the line. "Whenever I do reach out, I do something. When I don't, I'm alone. Yet I do reach out to them. I don't like the idea of leeching."

He'd had this conversation many times before, and nobody ever came up with a satisfactory answer. They all pretended like it was so easy, and it probably was. If you are in fact inside a circle of friends already. If you're just a point swerving around the perimeter, it's a lot tougher. He closed the IM window and looked at the empty screen. He decided right then and there to just give up. He'd no longer start to talk to someone if they didn't first talk to him. He'd stay at home unless someone invited him. He'd see how many people would actually make the effort.
