There is an interesting phenomenon going on in today's society. Being gifted is considered an absolute virtue. Even the name shows this, 'gifted'. As if we're supposed to consider it a gift. And then we're chastised for not conforming to absurdly high expectations.

Schools, particularly primary schools, do not know how to deal with people who are different. If you're behind, we might help you, every step of the way. But if you're ahead? Nope, good luck, enjoy the ride. Never mind all the challenges that gifted children face. Never mind the warped world view they end up with. You have a gift, now use it!

<!-- more -->

Because really, imagine being far ahead of your classmates at age seven. Who are you going to talk to? Nobody else is going to be interested in what you consider to be intellectual conversation at that age. Insistence only leads to ostracism. Therefore, many of these children end up deciding to either give up their intellectual pursuits, or their social life. The former group usually turns out to be _normal_, the latter ends up scarred for life.

Since normal is boring, let's talk about the second group. Somehow, you manage to put your intellectual desires above your social ones. Since in primary school everyone is at the same level, you get everything handed to you.  Many people get used to this. However, as you continue specialising your education, this is less and less true. Until it is no longer handed to you. The high expectations you grew up with lead you to believe you should be able to do it easily. People even go out of their way to tell you it should be easy for you. But it isn't. What then?

This is made more complicated by the fact that it usually isn't a _conscious_ choice. Few are capable of _knowingly_ giving up most social interaction. You end up at a double disadvantage. Both educationally and socially, it is an uphill battle. All human beings (excluding sociopaths) have a need to not be alone. So when, due to their lifestyle, loneliness is forced upon them, a depression develops which only serves to exacerbate the existing issues.

However, the problem is far more deep-seated than that. It is tempting to address this as a very black-and-white problem, but it isn't. You compare yourself to people who _seem_ to be happier. You ask yourself; what do they have that I don't? Friendship. Romance. Yes, friendship is important to be happy, but it alone will not make you happy. Romance on the other hand will only serve to make the other unhappy if attempted while struggling with depression.

So, how do we resolve this paradox? Your guess is as good as mine.
