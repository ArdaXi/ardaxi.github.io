Begin October this year, I took over maintaining AdSweep from the original author, Charles Landemaine. By then, I had tried to have it set up with an external database, but for a reason that is still not clear to me, it failed to work for a lot of people. So, I’d returned to the original AdSweep engine.

Since then, I have received a lot of feedback, with sites with unblocked ads and also sites which it breaks. I am currently working on updating them all and hoping I can release near January. However, seeing as this is the holiday season, I can't make any guarentees. I’m planning to incorporate a button next to Chrome's address bar which would disable AdSweep for that website on your computer, as a hotfix.

Now that that’s out of the way, I’d like to discuss something else. AdSweep’s home gets about 2 000 visitors daily. This also means the extension is downloaded a lot, which costs bandwidth. I’m fine with that, but it does bring bills I need to pay and as a student, I don’t have too much money to spare. So while I can understand not a lot of people have the cash, if you do, please [donate](http://arienh4.net/donate/) any amount you feel you can spare. It will help me make the time to work on AdSweep.
