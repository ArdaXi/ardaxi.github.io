Some holes in the Extensions documentation put some holes in my motivation over the last couple of days, but I've still been working hard. As such, I have more progress to report.
<!-- more -->For starters, I've finally included the disable functionality, and so far it seems to work. It took a lot of debugging and a lot of coffee, but now you don't have to wait on me to fix a broken website. I've also updated the options page, which is now most useful for deleting domains you've previously disabled. The caching is also a bit more friendly.

A beta is coming up when I know I've implemented all the features I want. Seeing as I received a lot of responses, I'll just make it an open beta. If you'd like to stay on the cutting edge though, I'd like to remind you that AdSweep is open-source and the source can be checked out at GitHub [here](http://github.com/arienh4/AdSweep).
