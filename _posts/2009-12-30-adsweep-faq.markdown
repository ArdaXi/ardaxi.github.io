I would like to address a few questions I've received quite often in this blog post. If there's anything not yet answered, please ask your questions either by email, twitter or in the comments and I'll try to address them as soon as possible.

**Why does AdSweep block YouTube videos?**
It doesn't. What happens is that AdSweep uses some code to remove ads from the YouTube player. Usually this works well, but occasionally something seems to go wrong in the script. Refreshing should fix the problem.

**Why do you never answer my emails?**
I get a lot of AdSweep emails daily. In an effort to preserve my sanity and my time, I usually won't respond unless I need to ask something or need to provide feedback. I do read all the emails though, don't worry.

**I sent you an email about this website x days ago and it still shows ads/is broken. What gives?**
Again, I read every email sent to me. However, updating a Chrome extension takes some time, and Chrome's auto-update system can be quite quirky, so I try to pack as much into one update I can, adding features as well. I'm due for an update though, so expect it soon.

**Add features? What features are you going to add?**
I don't have a definitive list, but I'm going to at least add a settings page, being able to whitelist pages and a button next to the address bar to disable AdSweep for that page. This can be used to fix broken pages, and to support a certain website who's ads you don't want to block.

_More questions pending._
