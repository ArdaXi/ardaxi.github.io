**FAQ**

**AdSweep breaks a certain site. Can I disable AdSweep for that site?**

Yes. Click the AdSweep icon next to theÂ address-bar and click "Disable ad-blocking for this site".

**What does 'Javascript-based blocking' mean?**

AdSweep has the ability to use Javascript code injected into the page to remove certain advertisements, such as YouTube ads in the videos. As this poses a security risk if my server ever got compromised, I disabled it by default. Use at your own risk.
